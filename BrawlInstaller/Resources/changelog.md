- Added a new "Palette Count" setting to cosmetic settings. This is the max palette count textures can have when color smashed. By default, this will be 256 (the maximum).
- Fixed an issue where fighters who were assigned trophies that did not actually exist were unable to be loaded.
- Fixed an issue where the application would crash if an error occurred when loading fighters.
