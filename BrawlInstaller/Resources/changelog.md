- Due to issues with the the costume swap code, the option to specify a costume ID when specifying an alternate fighter to load has been removed.
    - Alternate fighters will now always load the costume ID that corresponds to the selected costume.
- Fixed an issue where removing multiple macros would sometimes update codes in unexpected ways.
