- From the costume editor, you can configure a selected costume to load an alternate fighter.
    - This functionality requires your build to have the code `Character/Costume Swapper REVAMP [MarioDox]`.
    - To enable, configure the new "Costume Swap File" setting in your build settings to point to whatever file contains the above code.
    - The following controls will appear when you have a costume selected:
        - Load Alt Fighter: A dropdown that allows you to select an existing fighter to load instead of the selected costume. Whenever the selected costume is loaded in-game, the specified fighter will load instead. If left blank, costume will load normally.
        - Alt Costume ID: The costume ID to use from the alternate fighter instead of the currently-selected costume ID. If left blank, will default to currently-selected costume ID.
- When adding a new costume, if no ID above the currently-selected costume ID is available, the automatic ID selection will loop back starting from 0.
