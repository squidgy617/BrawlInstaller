- New feature: File Comparison and Patching
    - This feature allows you to compare BrawlLib-compatible files, generate patches based on their differences, and then apply those changes to files.
    - For more detailed information, view the "Files" page on the wiki.
- New field added to PAT0 settings: ID Type
    - Allows you to configure a different ID type between textures and frame indexes for installed cosmetics.
- Fighter, stage, music, and trophy lists will now extend the length of the window instead of having a fixed length.
