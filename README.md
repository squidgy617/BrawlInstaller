An all-in-one tool for managing mods in Brawl. Manage fighters, costumes, stages, music, and trophies with flexible tools that can support virtually any build.

# Features
- Add, edit, or delete all of the following in virtually any build:
    - Fighters

    - Music
    - Trophies
- Manage HD textures associated with any of the above.
- Quickly install fighters stored in BrawlInstaller's `.fighterpackage` format in just a few clicks.
- Create `.fighterpackage` files with ease, or extract them directly from a build.
- Automatic validation checks warn you of conflicts, and numerous controls in place to easily resolve said conflicts.
- Automatic backups created whenever BrawlInstaller makes a change, which can be restored when unexpected results occur.
